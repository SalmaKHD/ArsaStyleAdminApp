# ArsaStyleAdmin
 A companion app for inspecting ArsaStyle users.
 # App Overview
ArsaStyle is designed for making beauty salon appointments completely online. The easy user experience allows users to select any beauty salon in their chosen province and city, choose the services they'd like to receive, view all the available slots in real time (through the implementation of an algorithm), confirm their payment and get notifications prior to their appointments. 
The main app consists of two seperate views for users and for beauty salon owners for distinct functionalities. Beauty salon owners are able to add services, add their personnel if necessary, add working hours, and get time off as required. Through dedicated charts, beauty salon owners can see statistics related to their monthly income as well as number of visits.
The code for the main app has been omited, as ArsaStyle is planned to be published as soon as some issues on the backend side are resolved.
